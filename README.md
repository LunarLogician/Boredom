# ASCII Middle Finger Animation

Open `index.html` in a browser to see a slow ASCII animation that morphs a closed fist into a middle finger.

How to run:

- Option 1: Open directly
  - Double-click `index.html` or open it with your browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

- Option 2: Serve with a simple HTTP server (recommended for some browsers):
  - In a terminal, cd into the folder and run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Controls on the page:
- Pause / Play button
- Speed slider to slow down or speed up the animation
- Reset button to go back to the start frame

Enjoy the silly animation! (Non-explicit ASCII art; lighthearted.)
